        <h4> <center> A Brief History </center> </h4>
        <br>
        <p> Dr. Alan Turing was born on the 23rd of June 1912, in London England.  A highly intelligent child, with an aptitude for math and science, Dr. Turing played a critical role in the Second World War by leading a group known as Hut 8, a section of the Government Code and Cypher School.
        </p>
        <p>   Dr. Turing and his team developed methods to increase the speed at which German cyphers were broken; his work allowed the Allies to win pivotal battles against the Nazis. </p>
        <p>   Following the war, Dr. Turing worked at the National Physics Laboratory where he worked on the designs of the first stored-program computers. </p>
        <p> Of his work, what may be most notable today as we enter the age of Artificial Intelligence, is what is known as the Turing Test.  This is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour well enough to be indistinguishable from a human. </p>
        <p> Dr. Turing is remembered as a hero of the Second World War, a brilliant man, and for his incredible contributions to the field of Computer Science. </p>
